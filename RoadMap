Data with Python RoadMap

1. Basics
-Structured data: data that can be arranged in rows and columns to make a final clean analysis
-Unstructured data: data from images, social media, videos, websites etc.
-Basically, data science is a branch of statistics that deals with the extraction of data from selected sources and trying to make a meaningful analysis out of it. Or in other words…
                                                 Input(Collecting data)
                                                            |
                                                         Analyze
                                                            |     
                           Find something useful (make predictions or gather useful insights)
