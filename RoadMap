Data with Python RoadMap

1. Basics
-Structured data: data that can be arranged in rows and columns to make a final clean analysis
-Unstructured data: data from images, social media, videos, websites etc.
-Basically, data science is a branch of statistics that deals with the extraction of data from selected sources and trying to make a meaningful analysis out of it. Or in other words…
                                                 Input(Collecting data)
                                                            |
                                                         Analyze
                                                            |     
                           Find something useful (make predictions or gather useful insights) 

Areas to get started with python
●	Loops
●	Tuples
●	Lists
●	Dictionary
●	Functions
●	Decision-making statements
●	OOOPS Concept

Learnpython.org -seems like a good site to learn this.

Tools to use:
●	Jupiter notebook
●	Visual Studio Code                     

Python libraries for Data

●	Pandas(Tabular data i.e csv files or big data)
●	Numpy(Numerical data)
●	Seaborn (Visualisation)
●	matplotlib (Visualisation-extended version of matplotlib)
